# Asteroids
This is a game I made to test my knowledge of C++.

If you want to run this game for yourself, go to the Releases section on the right side and download and run the .exe file.

## Credits
- Microsoft Visual Studio - Where I write my code
- Windows - Where I run the code
- YouTube - Where I researched how to complete this.

## To do
- [ ] Fix bug where bigger asteroids (when spawning) cause the player to lose the game for no reason.
